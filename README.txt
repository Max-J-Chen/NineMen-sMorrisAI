To run the program, open the terminal in the same directory as the executable.
Type: "python executible_name.py number" with the number being the depth at which
you want to run the program at. There are "input" and "output" folders in the same directory
as the executable. Any output is named as the "executible_nameOutput.txt" and is stored in 
the output folder. Input boards can be placed in the input folder and are selected with 
the file explorer after starting the executable.

Note: There is a GUI that I made for fun in main.py. If you choose to run that, you can play against
the selected AI. Clicking intersections on the board will let you place the pieces of your selected
player color. Clicking existing pieces will delete them. The "End Turn" button will send the board
to whichever selected AI algorithm to produce the best board for the opposite color. Note, that this 
results in much slower results.
